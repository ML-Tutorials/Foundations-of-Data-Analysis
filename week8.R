# Week 8 ONE-SAMPLE T TESTS Tutorial 

# In this lab you will be working with data from the Professional Bull Riders Association.
# 
# 1. Open RStudio. Make sure you've installed the SDSFoundations package.
# 2. Type library(SDSFoundations) This will automatically load the data for the labs. 
# 3.Type bull <- BullRiders This will assign the data to your Workspace.
# 
# Alternatively, you can use follow the steps in the "Importing a Data Frame" R tutorial video, and use the BullRiders.csv file. (Right-click and "Save As.") Make sure to name the dataframe "bull" when importing.
# 
# 1. Open RStudio.
# 2. Click on "Import Dataset" button at the top of the workspace window. Choose "from text file."
# 3. Click on the location of the BullRiders.csv file you just downloaded.
# 4. Click on the BullRiders.csv file. Then, click Upload.

bull <- BullRiders 

# So suppose you want to test a claim that the mean age of bull riders in this season was 30 years old. This is the 2012 
# season, and because we have the year that they were born, we can calculate pretty quickly their current age at that season.

age <- 2012 - bull$YearBorn

age

# An important assumption of a one-sample t-test that we're going to have to check is that the distribution of our variable
# age is approximately normally distributed. And we can get a quick look at the distribution of our variable by just creating # a histogram.
hist(ageï¼Œ breaks=6)
# Approximately normally distributed. There's no outliers, no serious skewness going on. So we are good to go with our
# normality assumption.

# So to do a one-sample t-test in R, we just use the t.test function. The first argument we need to give it is our vector of
# numbers, that is, our sample, which is age. And then as another option, we give it the value in our null hypothesis, which
# is going to be 30 years old.
t.test(age, mu = 30)

# One Sample t-test
# 
# data:  age
# t = -5.5446, df = 37, p-value = 2.599e-06
# alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 30
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#     25.32877 27.82912
# sample estimates:
#     mean of x 
# 26.57895 

# Our p-value is definitely less than 0.05. So we would reject the null hypothesis here that the population mean is equal to
# 30 years old. Notice that it also gives us a 95% confidence interval of the true mean age based off our sample mean, which
# is also given, 26.57 years. 

# One other line that it gives you here is the alternative hypothesis that the true mean is not equal to 30. So this is
# corresponding to a two-sided alternative hypothesis. And that's because we haven't specified one, and the two-sided is just
# the default alternative that we use.

# If we wanted to go into this t-test saying there's no way that the mean age is greater than 30, it's got to be less than if
# it's anything, we could have a one-sided alternative hypothesis. And do that in R, we just need to add one more
# option, which is called alternative. Then we give it the word either "less" or "greater" in quotes, and that defines the
# direction of our alternative.

# So if we think that the mean age of these bull riders is actually less than 30, then we'll say alternative equals "less,"
# re-run it.
t.test(age, mu = 30, alternative = "less")

# One Sample t-test
# 
# data:  age
# t = -5.5446, df = 37, p-value = 1.299e-06
# alternative hypothesis: true mean is less than 30
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#     -Inf 27.6199
# sample estimates:
#     mean of x 
# 26.57895 

# Notice our t and degrees of freedom are exactly the same. Our p-value does change, though, when we switch from a two-sided
# to one-sided. And also notice when we have a one-sided, less than 30 alternative hypothesis, our confidence interval gives
# us a bound that is either negative infinity or positive infinity. And that's because we usually don't talk about confidence
# intervals when we go into a t-test knowing that the mean is either less than or greater than the claimed value.
